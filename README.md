# PHPMailer

**PHPMailer** ‚Äì A full-featured email creation and transfer class for PHP.

## Features

- Probably the world's most popular code for sending email from PHP!
- Used by many open-source projects: **WordPress, Drupal, 1CRM, SugarCRM, Yii, Joomla!**, and many more.
- Integrated **SMTP** support ‚Äì send emails without a local mail server.
- Send emails with multiple **To**, **CC**, **BCC**, and **Reply-to** addresses.
- **Multipart/alternative** emails for mail clients that do not read HTML email.
- Add attachments, including inline attachments for images.
- Supports **UTF-8** content and various encodings like **8bit, base64, binary, and quoted-printable**.
- **SMTP authentication** with mechanisms such as **LOGIN**, **PLAIN**, **CRAM-MD5**, and **XOAUTH2** over SMTPS and SMTP+STARTTLS.
- Validates email addresses automatically.
- Protects against header injection attacks.
- **Error messages** in over 50 languages.
- Supports **DKIM** and **S/MIME** signing.
- Compatible with **PHP 5.5** and later, including **PHP 8.1**.
- Namespaced to prevent name clashes.

## Why You Might Need PHPMailer

Many PHP developers need to send emails from their code, but the built-in `mail()` function offers limited functionality, lacking features such as encryption, authentication, HTML emails, and attachments. **PHPMailer** simplifies these tasks, while also making sure that emails are formatted and sent correctly according to complex email standards.

### Example Scenarios:

- **Sending from Windows**: Windows does not include a local mail server by default. PHPMailer's integrated **SMTP** client works on all platforms, including Windows, allowing you to send emails without a local mail server.
- **Security**: When sending sensitive data, **SMTP over TLS** provides encryption and authentication, which is not supported by the native `mail()` function.

> **Note**: It is both safer and faster to use **SMTP** than the native `mail()` function when sending emails from PHP.

### Alternatives to PHPMailer

While PHPMailer is widely used and robust, other libraries you can consider include **SwiftMailer, Laminas/Mail**, and **ZetaComponents**.

## Installation & Loading

### Composer Installation

PHPMailer is available on **Packagist**, and installation via **Composer** is the recommended way to install it. Add the following line to your `composer.json` file:

```
"phpmailer/phpmailer": "^6.5"
```

Or run the following command:

```
composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
```

### Manual Installation

Alternatively, if you‚Äôre not using Composer, you can download PHPMailer as a zip file, extract it, and copy the **PHPMailer** folder into one of the `include_path` directories specified in your PHP configuration. Then, load the required classes manually:
```
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;  
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/Exception.php';  
require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/PHPMailer.php';  
require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/SMTP.php';
```

> **Note**: You need to include the **Exception** class even if you're not using exceptions because PHPMailer uses it internally.

### Minimal Installation

For projects where you don‚Äôt need the full package, the minimal files required are:

- **src/PHPMailer.php**
- **src/SMTP.php** (if using **SMTP**)
- **src/OAuth.php** (if using **XOAUTH2**)
- You can skip the **language** folder if English-only errors are sufficient.

## A Simple Example

Here's how you can send an email using **PHPMailer** with **SMTP**:
```
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;  
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;  
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

// Load Composer's autoloader  
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Create an instance; passing `true` enables exceptions  
$mail = new PHPMailer(true);

try {  
    // Server settings  
    $mail->SMTPDebug = SMTP::DEBUG_SERVER; // Enable verbose debug output  
    $mail->isSMTP();                       // Send using SMTP  
    $mail->Host       = 'smtp.example.com'; // Set the SMTP server  
    $mail->SMTPAuth   = true;               // Enable SMTP authentication  
    $mail->Username   = 'user@example.com'; // SMTP username  
    $mail->Password   = 'secret';           // SMTP password  
    $mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_SMTPS; // Enable TLS encryption  
    $mail->Port       = 465;                // TCP port to connect to

    // Recipients  
    $mail->setFrom('from@example.com', 'Mailer');  
    $mail->addAddress('joe@example.net', 'Joe User');  
    $mail->addReplyTo('info@example.com', 'Information');  
    $mail->addCC('cc@example.com');  
    $mail->addBCC('bcc@example.com');

    // Attachments  
    $mail->addAttachment('/var/tmp/file.tar.gz');  
    $mail->addAttachment('/tmp/image.jpg', 'new.jpg');

    // Content  
    $mail->isHTML(true);                   // Set email format to HTML  
    $mail->Subject = 'Here is the subject';  
    $mail->Body    = 'This is the HTML message body <b>in bold!</b>';  
    $mail->AltBody = 'This is the plain text for non-HTML mail clients';

    $mail->send();  
    echo 'Message has been sent';  
} catch (Exception $e) {  
    echo "Message could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}";  
}
```

This example shows how to send an HTML email with attachments. Modify the settings to suit your **SMTP** server.

## Localization

PHPMailer defaults to English but includes error message translations in over 50 languages. To set a specific language, use the following method:

```
$mail->setLanguage('fr', '/optional/path/to/language/directory/');
```

You can find the translations in the **language** folder, and you‚Äôre encouraged to contribute new languages or corrections.

Formatting email correctly is surprisingly difficult. There are myriad overlapping (and conflicting) standards, requiring tight adherence to horribly complicated formatting and encoding rules ‚Äì the vast majority of code that you'll find online that uses the mail() function directly is just plain wrong, if not unsafe!

The PHP mail() function usually sends via a local mail server, typically fronted by a sendmail binary on Linux, BSD, and macOS platforms, however, Windows usually doesn't include a local mail server; PHPMailer's integrated SMTP client allows email sending on all platforms without needing a local mail server. Be aware though, that the mail() function should be avoided when possible; it's both faster and safer to use SMTP to localhost.

Please don't be tempted to do it yourself ‚Äì if you don't use PHPMailer, there are many other excellent libraries that you should look at before rolling your own. Try SwiftMailer , Laminas/Mail, ZetaComponents etc.
